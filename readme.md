### Hi, I'm Paul,


I'm a Full-Stack Developer with keen interest in creating enterprise level web applications for various domains. 

I use Python/Django in the backend and various JavaScript Frameworks in the front end. 

I have also worked with tools/technologies like RestAPI, Postgres, Celery, WebRTC,  Progressive Web Apps, etc.

I'm driven by passion for designing and developing end to end solutions, and managing its life-cycle.
